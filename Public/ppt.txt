Slide 1: Title Slide
Speaking Notes:

“Good morning, everyone.
Today, we’re diving into a question that’s on everyone’s mind — Is Artificial Intelligence a threat to human jobs, or is it a doorway to new opportunities?
As AI continues to evolve, so does its impact on how we work, live, and connect.
Let’s explore both sides of the argument with a balanced perspective.”

Slide 2: The Threat Perspective
Speaking Notes:

“Let’s begin with the threats.
AI and automation are already transforming industries like manufacturing, retail, and logistics.
Tasks that were once manual — such as quality checks or shelf stocking — are now handled by machines.
In customer service, we see chatbots replacing entry-level jobs. In data-heavy roles, algorithms can analyze faster and more accurately than humans.
These changes raise a valid concern — low-skill, repetitive jobs are increasingly at risk, which could lead to unemployment if we’re not prepared.”

Slide 3: The Opportunity Angle
Speaking Notes:
“Now, on the flip side — AI also opens up tremendous opportunities.
Rather than replacing us entirely, AI can enhance our productivity by automating routine work and freeing us for creative and strategic thinking.
New roles are emerging in fields like AI ethics, data science, prompt engineering, and human-AI collaboration.
Moreover, AI improves safety, reduces human error, and supports flexible work environments.
In many ways, AI is enabling a better quality of work — not just more of it.”

Slide 4: Balanced Viewpoint
Speaking Notes:
“So, is AI a threat or an opportunity?
The truth is — it depends on how we approach it.
Yes, there will be job losses, skill gaps, and wage pressure. But at the same time, there’s job creation, upskilling potential, and huge gains in productivity.
The question is not ‘Will AI take our jobs?’, but rather ‘Are we ready to evolve alongside AI?’
Just like the Industrial Revolution or the rise of the internet, this is another transformative wave.”

Slide 5: Conclusion & Call to Action
Speaking Notes:
“To prepare for the future, we must act now.
That means continuously learning new skills, adapting to new technologies, and finding ways to combine human creativity with AI efficiency.
Change is inevitable, but fear isn’t necessary.
I’d like to end with this thought-provoking quote:
‘AI will not replace you. A person using AI will.’

Thank you.”
